# Projects

It is my repositories holding most of the coding projects I have done in college. It is a place to hold my projects I did over the semester. I am part of the graduction class of 2020 of Rowan Unviersity, getting a Bachelor of Science Biological Science, and Certificate of Undergraduate Studies Computer Programming. I learned the coding learnings of Java, C++, C, Linux, and R

##### Advance Programming Workshop: R
+ Programming languages, integrated development environments, application programming interfaces, software packages, and libraries are examples of programming technologies. 

##### Computer Science And Programming in C++
+ This course emphasizes programming methodology, algorithms and simple data structures. A programming language rich
enough to allow easy implementation of data structures is studied. Prior programming experience in any programming
language is expected for this course. 

##### Data Science for Biologists
+ Modern-day biological research produces volumes of data that all scientists need the skills to
analyze. In this course, students will learn and apply foundational concepts in data science,
including visualization, wrangling, modeling, and communicating using open-source and
reproducible frameworks. This course assumes no background in any computer programming
or other computational skills.

+ The final assignment in the class is making a shiny Covid app [here](https://github.com/shahp7/datascience_final_assignment)
+ The extra credits in the class was doing the TidyTuesday [here](https://github.com/shahp7/TidyTuesday)

#### Principles of Data Structures in Java
+ The course features programs of realistic complexity. The programs utilize data structures (strings, lists, graphs, stacks) and
algorithms (searching, sorting, etc.) for manipulating these data structures. The course emphasizes interactive design and
includes the use of microcomputer systems and direct access data files
